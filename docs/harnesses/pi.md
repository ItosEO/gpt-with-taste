# Pi

Use the Pi adapter to add GPT with Taste while retaining Pi's system prompt, tools, project instructions, skills and permission decisions. The default entry applies Main and request-local User Steer to selected `openai` or `openai-codex` models whose IDs start with `gpt-`.

Requires **Pi 1.2.0+** (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`) and **Node.js 22.19+**. The adapter has no runtime dependencies and makes no extra model calls.

## Install

```sh
pi install git:github.com/NB-Corp/gpt-with-taste
```

Pi loads the generated adapter through the repository's root `pi.extensions` entry. Run `/reload` in an existing session after installation, then `/taste status` to see the role, selected-model scope decision, steering state and resource location. The status command does not call a model.

Run `pi update --extensions` when you want the latest committed adapter. Remove it with `pi remove git:github.com/NB-Corp/gpt-with-taste`.

## Try a local build

From this repository:

```sh
node scripts/build.mjs --target pi
pi -e ./dist/pi/index.js
```

For a copied project installation, place the **whole** `dist/pi` directory in `<project>/.pi/extensions/gpt-with-taste`. For user-wide use, copy it to `<agent-dir>/extensions/gpt-with-taste`, normally `~/.pi/agent/extensions/gpt-with-taste`, then restart Pi. Project extensions follow Pi's project-trust controls.

Keep one installation active: use the package, a local `-e` entry or a copied directory. This adapter does not need `.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` or `SYSTEM.md`; leave existing files unchanged.

## Control and recover

- `/taste off` stops future request-local additions on the current session branch.
- `/taste on` enables them again, within the configured provider/model scope.
- `/taste steer off` keeps the full role text but disables input/result reminders; `/taste steer on` restores them.
- `/taste reset` clears branch overrides. Overrides survive resume and follow the active branch.

To disable a one-session load, exit Pi and omit `-e` on the next launch. For a copied installation, move the `gpt-with-taste` directory **out of** `extensions/` and restart Pi; move it back and restart to restore it. Do not rename only the directory inside `extensions/`, because Pi would still discover `index.js`.

If startup reports a missing or empty text file, rebuild and replace the complete copied directory, then restart Pi. Change behavior in `recipe/`, never in the generated Markdown. If a final-request warning names an unsupported payload format, the Pi system section still applies, but recovering from a forced system-prompt replacement requires a guard for that provider's wire format. A later payload-rewriting extension can also override delivery; load it deliberately and inspect its effect.

## Choose a collaborator role

Pi's `input.source` describes transport (`interactive`, `rpc`, `extension`), not agent identity. A child integration must load `dist/pi/sub.js` **instead of** `index.js`, or use the factory:

```js
import {createTasteExtension} from '/absolute/path/to/dist/pi/runtime.mjs';
export default createTasteExtension({role: 'sub'});
```

Sub uses the full Sub text and Sub Steer for its unanswered inputs. It does not receive User Steer or completed-result Agent Steer. `dist/pi/independent.js` selects Independent with steering off. These entries preserve the child's own assignment, tools, model and authority; the child loader must actually load the chosen entry.

A parent integration can declare custom message types that guarantee a completed collaborator result:

```js
import {createTasteExtension} from '/absolute/path/to/dist/pi/runtime.mjs';
export default createTasteExtension({
  completedResultTypes: ['my-collaborator:completed'],
});
```

The collaborator delivers its actual result with Pi's `sendMessage` API and that exact `customType`. The adapter preserves the result and adds request-local Agent Steer after it. Use different types for progress, failures, timeouts and background handles. Ordinary tool results have no completion adapter by default; a tool integration must signal its concrete completion contract through the declared custom message type. This adapter does not poll or trigger additional turns.

Factory options also accept `providers: ['your-provider']` and `modelIdPattern: /^your-model$/` to change scope. Scope follows the selected model, not a virtual model's routed physical target. Load the wrapper instead of the default entry.

## Generated files and delivery

`adapters/pi/build.mjs` renders `dist/pi/` from the six recipe texts. The generated package contains:

- `index.js`, `sub.js`, `independent.js`: host-loadable entries;
- `runtime.mjs`, `projection.mjs`, `payload.mjs`: transport code;
- `texts.json` and the six Markdown files it names: runtime resources;
- `package.json`, `PROVENANCE.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSE`, `build-manifest.json`: package and build metadata.

`context_with_system` adds a dedicated `gpt_with_taste` section without replacing host sections. It projects hidden reminders only after inputs or declared completed custom messages newer than the last assistant response. Tool continuations do not repeat them. `before_provider_request` restores a missing full role block in OpenAI Responses/Codex Responses or Chat Completions with an existing system/developer message; it preserves host instructions, tools and result content. Text and reminders are request-local, not persisted conversation entries.

Run the model-free consumer fixture from this repository:

```sh
node adapters/pi/test.mjs
```

It imports the generated entry, registers and invokes its callbacks, and checks source delivery, role isolation, completion routing, repeat projection, payload preservation and off/reset controls. It does not contact a provider.

Thanks to [SpadeLushen/pi-gpt-with-taste](https://github.com/SpadeLushen/pi-gpt-with-taste) for the Pi port and its request-local injection and final-payload guard. This adapter adapts its MIT-licensed transport at commit `07013409c19fe307d0a951ef5f2b3f72f4c837b3`; `PROVENANCE.md` records the adopted code and changes, and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSE` retains the license.
